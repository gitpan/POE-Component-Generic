*TODO*

- Better contexts for error messages [caller]
- ->call, ->yield and ->method should return the request/response ID so
    that it can be corrolated with the response.
- User data in the request data hash shouldn't be serialised
- Test case for Net::DNS
- Test case for some core blocking module
- Leak test
- Error conditions could be reported with ErrorEvent.
- Document how to overloading POE::Component::Generic::Child, which 
    could be necessary for more complex modules.
- Package profiles :
    POE::Component::Net::SSH2 (wrapper for Net::SSH2) then, when someone
        wants to write a pure-POE SSH2 module, they already have an
        interface and test cases to write too.
    PoCo::Generic's data hash ({event=>''}) becomes de facto 
        inter-component calling convention.  I WIN.
- { event=>"__AUTO__" } called from event "foo1" will be converted into
    { event=>"foo2" }
- The object returned by ->spawn and used to call methods needs to be
    different from the object used internaly by PoCo::Generic so we stop
    polluting its namespace
- Respawn the child, like EasyDBI does
- A tutorial about factory methods, etc
