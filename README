POE::Component::Generic is POE component that provides non-blocking access
to a blocking object. 

It works by forking of a sub-process with POE::Wheel::Run to do the work
The object is created in the child process, which waits for method calls 
from the parent.

It is intended for people who want to use an object that blocks from
POE with as little pain as possible.


POE::Component::Generic can be installed the usual ways:

Through the CPAN shell:

	perl -MCPAN -e 'install "POE::Component::Generic"'

Or by downloading it and running the usual commands:

	perl Makefile.PL
	make test
	make install

It is possible to configure some of the test cases by passing arguments to
Makefile.PL.

    perl Makefile.PL --help
