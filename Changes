0.1202 Fri Sep 11 2009
    - Use POE::Wheel::Run->PID instead of $$ from the child

    - Fix a bunch of warnings that were previously hidden by POE turning off
        warnings.
        - Thank you Hinrik
    - Added 01_pod and 02_pod_coverage

0.1200 Wed Mar 11 2009
    - Better handling of shutdown, delete wheel on CHLD.  Now the session
      may _stop, even if the kernel keeps on.
        Thank you Paul Williams.  Closes RT 44039
    - Unit tests for above
    - Create a smaller closure to run the child process

0.1101 Thu Sep 04 2008 
    - Internal release

0.1100 Wed Jan 23 2008
    - Did away with mapping PBids to session/event tupples.  This allows
        us to completely ignore postback GC issues, at the cost of slightly
        modifying postback semantics.  Win!
        Closes RT 32067, thank you Paul Driver.
